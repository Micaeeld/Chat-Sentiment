# Text Classification Program

This program uses Machine Learning algorithms to classify texts into three categories: positive, negative and neutral. The program uses a dataset containing several manually classified texts to train the classification model.

## Prerequisites

To run this program you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Python packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, textblob, re, unidecode, matplotlib, seaborn, collections, wordcloud, nltk

## How it works

The program uses two Machine Learning algorithms called MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB to classify texts into three categories: positive, negative and neutral.

The algorithm is trained using a dataset that contains a number of manually classified texts. The dataset is processed to extract the features relevant to the classification, which are then used to train the model.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new texts by comparing text features with features extracted from the training dataset.
